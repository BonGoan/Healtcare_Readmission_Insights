**Predicting Hospital Readmissions: A Data-Driven Approach**

**Project Overview**

Hospital readmissions pose a critical challenge for healthcare systems, affecting patient outcomes and hospital finances. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict hospital readmissions using patient data, enabling healthcare providers to identify high-risk patients and potentially prevent unnecessary readmissions.

**The Process**

The workflow for this project follows a structured approach, covering several phases:
1.	Data Sourcing:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 25,000 patient records with 18 columns. This data was analyzed, cleaned and preprocessed for model building (cleaned dataset = 25,000 and 7 columns).
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
A thorough EDA was used to understand the dataset, perform initial cleaning, and explore deep statistics. This includes summarizing numerical and categorical variables and examining relationships using statistical tests.
3.	Modelling Approach:
11 models were created. Each model had a Base Model, Balanced Model â€“ using SMOTE and Tuned Model - using grid search.
In the context of healthcare, where the reducing readmissions is critical, high recall  and f1 were used to make decisions to compare performances of the models
This would help in predicting less false negatives making it highly effective for early intervention strategies.
  
**Key Insights:**

1.	Model Selection:
The Gradient Boosting Tuned model was chosen for its high recall, making it valuable for identifying patients at risk of readmission.
2.	Feature Importance:
The most critical features include time in hospital, patient age, number of lab procedures, and certain primary diagnoses (musculoskeletal conditions and diabetes). These can help healthcare providers tailor interventions for at-risk patients.
3.	Comparison with Other Models:
The Gradient Boosting model showed superior generalization capabilities compared to other models, making it the most reliable predictor for this dataset.

**Real World Implications**

1. Preventive Healthcare: By accurately predicting which patients are likely to be readmitted, healthcare providers can design interventions, such as closer monitoring or specific treatment plans, to reduce readmissions.
2. Optimized Resources: Targeting at-risk patients allows hospitals to better allocate resources, reducing unnecessary readmissions and improving patient outcomes.

**Conclusion**

This project applied machine learning to predict hospital readmissions, offering actionable insights for improving patient care and reducing costs. The Gradient Boosting Tuned model provided the best balance between recall and precision, making it the optimal choice for healthcare interventions. It highlights the value of data-driven approaches in enhancing patient outcomes and resource allocation. Implementing this or advanced models can significantly improve healthcare efficiency.
